		    </br>
			Dont steal other players cargo's, dont kill your allies. Dont start sensless fights about cargo's, Tanker is the one who takes
			the cargo, if you want the cargo, you should ask tanker if you can take his cargo or you should be the one tanking the Alien.
			</br>
			</br>
			Try to doscuss the problem rather than starting a mini war in the middle of the map. The benefits will be more as you will notice,
			because killing an ally will not win you anything, you will lose credits and Npc points.

			Greetings Space Pilots, 
			</br>
			The Andromeda chat is for conversation and communication between users only. 
			</br>
			There are very many people who use the chat, and this number of users continues to increase on a daily basis. That's why there are certain rules to abide while using the chat in order to make things easier for us all. Otherwise we won't be able to read anything anymore and the chat will become a pure and utter mess. 
			</br>
			</br>
			<font color='#00AAFF'>9. Follow the instructions</font>
			</br>
			</br>
			1.b) The instructions of the moderators are to be followed at all times. 
			</br>
			1.b) Disagreements with decisions are not to be discussed openly, but should instead be sent in written form to the responsible Support Team member. 
			</br>

			</br>
			<font color='#00AAFF'>10. Spam / Flooding</font>
			</br>
			</br>
			Any form of spam/e-mail flooding are not allowed. Violations will result in a chat ban. 
			</br>
			</br>
			<font color='#00AAFF'>11. Insults</font>
			</br>
			</br>
			Insulting other users in our chat will not be tolerated. If someone insults you, please report it to a chat moderator or administrator immediately. 
			</br>
			</br>
			<font color='#00AAFF'>12. Behavior / tone of language</font>
			</br>
			</br>
			Even if a conversation "heats up" or you get angry: Please keep a reasonable tone of language. Always handle the other players and the moderators with the same respect you want to receive from others. 
			</br>
			Racist, sexist, and political comments or obscene language will lead to your account being suspended without any prior notice. The power to make this decision is the responsibility of the chat moderators. 
			</br>
			</br>
			<font color='#00AAFF'>13. Advertising</font>
			</br>
			</br>
			The advertising of products, other websites or any other similar items is strictly forbidden. 
			</br>
			</br>
			<font color='#00AAFF'>14. Contact data</font>
			</br>
			</br>
			You're not allowed to post any contact data in the chat.
			</br>
			This includes ICQ, MSN, Teamspeak IPs, phone numbers, addresses, Skype, etc. 
			</br>
			</br>
			<font color='#00AAFF'>15. Criticism of other clans or companies</font>
			</br>
			Slandering other clans is also considered to be an insult and will not be tolerated. 

			</br>
			</br>
			<font color='#00AAFF'>16. Capitalization</font>
			</br>
			</br>
			Writing in uppercase letters is not allowed. The only exception is for clan tags. 
			</br>
			</br>
			<font color='#00AAFF'>17. Nickname</font>
			</br>
			</br>
			If the chat provider offers you the option of selecting your own personal nickname, don't choose something which insults other users or which has the goal of angering other users such as with nickname fakes. It goes without saying that racist or violence glorifying nicks are also forbidden. 
			</br>
			</br>
			<font color='#00AAFF'>18. Stay anonymous</font>
			</br>
			</br>
			Do not post your password or any other confidential information in the chat, or anywhere else in the game. 
			</br>
			</br>
			<font color='#00AAFF'>19. Report harassment</font>
			</br>
			</br>
			If you are sexually harassed in a chat, create a screenshot and write down the date and time as well as the nickname of the player who made the comment. You can file charges with the police, and with our help the police will be able to identify the player who harassed you and take appropriate action. 
			</br>
			</br>
			<font color='#00AAFF'>20. Say NO </font>
			</br>
			</br>
			No one can force you to continue a discussion which is uncomfortable for you. You don't have to answer anyone you don't want to. If someone puts pressure on you, just report it to the chat moderators or the administrators. 
			</br>
			</br>
			<font color='#00AAFF'>21. A meeting? - Never alone!</font>
			</br>
			</br>
			Someone from the chat/game wants to meet you? Think it over carefully if you really want to meet up with them and talk about it with your parents and your friends. Select a busy location and make sure a few good friends are nearby. Stay at the agreed upon place -- regardless of what someone might promise you. You never know what kind of a person is waiting for you there. 
			</br>
			I think that everyone can obey the rules.
			</br>
			Sick to the rules and make the chat a pleasant place to be for everyone.
			</br>
			</br>
			<font color='#00AAFF'>Have fun playing. Your Andromeda Team.</font>
